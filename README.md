Naive Bayes classifier
My own implementation for the naive bayes classifier

In my recent project, I implemented a Naive Bayes classifier, a foundational machine learning algorithm. I began by cleaning and processing the data, then visualized it to uncover insights. With a refined dataset, I trained the classifier and evaluated its performance, refining it for optimal results. This journey not only produced a robust model but also deepened my understanding of the nuances of data analysis and machine learning.
